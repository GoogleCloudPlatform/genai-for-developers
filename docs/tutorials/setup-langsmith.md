### LangSmith LLM tracing configuration

Create a LangSmith account and generate a Service API key in the Settings section. https://docs.smith.langchain.com/ 

Set environment variables required for LangSmith integration. Replace Service API key before running the commands.

```
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=langsmith-service-api-key
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
```
